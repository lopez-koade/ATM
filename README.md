## Description

This is a project to simulate an Automated Teller Machine to make basic operations such as deposits, withdrawals, currency exchanges, checking balances and statements, create a new account and change the PIN.<br>


## Objectives

Create a user-friendly text-based interface.<br>
Let the user choose either a pre-generated account with random currency figures or create a new account. Check if the PIN inserted/created is valid.<br>
Check if the user inserts a valid option and keep them in a loop if they choose a wrong option. Show them valid options again after every wrong option chosen. Handle InputMismatchException.<br>
Let the user check the accounts balance.<br>
Let the user make deposits, withdrawals and currency exchange opertations among three currency accounts, updating and informing the user about the new balance in each account and generating a transaction statement after every transaction.<br>
Let the user print an statement showing all transactions.<br>
Let the user change the PIN.

## My process

- Outline the sections of the ATM and create a tree with the options that would come up down the line. 
- Set up Eclipse IDE project and link it to GitHub.
- Create program entry letting user choose between new or existing account.
- Create Account class and display menu, then create a method for every menu option with accesory methods.
- Debug along the way.
